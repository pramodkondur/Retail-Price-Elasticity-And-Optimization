<img src="./priceOptim.png">

## **Business Problem**

FashionElite is a clothing retailer specializing in a diverse selection of apparel and accessories, operating both physical stores and an online e-commerce platform. To enhance its revenue and market competitiveness, the company aims to optimize its pricing strategy.

FashionElite faces several challenges in effectively pricing its products.

- Competitive Landscape: With numerous rivals offering similar products, the retail industry is highly competitive. FashionElite aims to stand out by offering attractive prices while ensuring profitability.

- Inventory Management: Ensuring effective inventory management is vital for FashionElite, as pricing strategies must balance supply and demand. Optimizing prices based on inventory levels can help prevent overstocking or understocking of products.

- Seasonal and Trend Variations: The fashion industry's rapid trend changes and fluctuating demand throughout the year present challenges for FashionElite. Adjusting prices to reflect seasonal and trend shifts is crucial to capitalize on sales opportunities.

## **Solution**

Price Optimization can be used for tacking above challenges. We will be trying the following strategies

- Demand based pricing : The demand-based pricing strategy involves analyzing the demand for each product over time
to determine the optimal price for each product. The strategy involves setting a base
price for each product, and then adjusting the price based on the demand for the product.

- Competitor based pricing : The competitor-based pricing strategy involves analyzing the prices of competitors for
the same product and adjusting the price based on the competitor’s pricing.

- Price elasticity based pricing : The price elasticity-based pricing strategy involves analyzing the price elasticity of
each product to determine the optimal price for each product. The strategy involves
setting a base price for each product, and then adjusting the price based on the
price elasticity of the product.

**Recommendations**

- Pricing Strategy

  - In terms of pricing strategy, the Price Elasticity to Demand strategy seems most effective. This strategy is completely based on customer demand and reaction to change in price.
  - In this strategy, we have only changed the prices of products that are Inelastic, i.e. the products who change in price does not affect customer demand.
  - This also resulted in higher sales for all the months.

- Product Related

  - Holidays are extremely important. Months with higher number of holidays have higher sales.  
  - Due to higher number of customers during holidays, new products can be introduced to increase awareness.

## **Conclusion**

- Our analysis highlights the critical role of price elasticity in optimizing our pricing strategy. By focusing on products with inelastic demand, we were able to adjust prices without negatively impacting customer demand, effectively increasing sales across all months.
  
- This price optimization strategy resulted in 8.7% percent change in total sales over the period, demonstrating the effectiveness of adjusting prices for inelastic products.
  
- Thus, this targeted approach allows us to streamline our pricing decisions and ensures sustainable growth through smarter, data-driven price optimization.
